## Setup

Run 'MNIST_nn.py' and 'CIFAR10_nn.py' to created pickled output data. Then run 'Run_plots.py' to get the plots of the corresponding data. All the required methods are in the file 'MNIST_nn_methods.py'.

Run 'MNIST_nn_Nodes_Samples_Variants.py' to obtain results of variants where only the k-fastest nodes participate and only k randomly selected nodes participate.

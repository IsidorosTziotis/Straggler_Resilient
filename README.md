# Straggler Resilient Federated Learning

Welcome to the code repo for Straggler-Resilient Federated Learning.
This is the code used to generate all the neural network experiments in the paper "Straggler-Resilient Federated Learning: Leveraging the InterplayBetween Statistical Accuracy and System Heterogeneity".

## Setup

Run 'MNIST_nn.py' and 'CIFAR10_nn.py' to created pickled output data. Then run 'Run_plots.py' to get the plots of the corresponding data. All the required methods are in the file 'MNIST_nn_methods.py'.

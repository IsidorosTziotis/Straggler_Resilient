## Straggler Resilient Federated Learning

Welcome to the code repo for Straggler-Resilient Federated Learning.
This is the code used to generate all the experiments in the paper "Straggler-Resilient Federated Learning: Leveraging the 
InterplayBetween Statistical Accuracy and System Heterogeneity".

The experiments are separeated into folders with corresponding README files where setup instructions can be found.
